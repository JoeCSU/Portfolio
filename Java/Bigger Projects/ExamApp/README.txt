This project was created with the Netbean's IDE.

The program requires a MySQL database connection on the same machine that it is to be run on or it will not operate. An exported database script is included here though I have not verified that it will work when imported on another machine. If it does or doesn't, please let me know :). The required MySQL version is 5.7.

Instructions:

If it can connect to the appropriate database, a "Welcome" screen will load asking for username and password. The username is "admin" and the password is "password"

ISSUES: The program obviously has many many issues still, some major ones include:

-Further input validation is needed
-GUI can be unresponsive, require multiple button clicks (Javafx?)
-Password and user name need to be able to be changed
-Multiple admins should be allowed which would require the database to be altered as well
-Program aesthetics need further refinement
-export of grade reports should a) be output other than to text file (pdf for example) and b) have, or allow the user to customize the folder to which files are output.
-Many, many others (allow a calculator widget during exam, images\graphics like a periodic table or other diagrams as part of questions)

I plan to continue to work on this project as time allows, if you would like to contribute please do so, or if you are working on a similar project and looking for contributors please email me :).
