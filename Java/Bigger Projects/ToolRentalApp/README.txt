This project was created with the Netbeans's IDE and can be run easily from it.

Instructions:

To run the program start it, and then select the appropriate database text files, whcih are Customers.txt, tools.txt, and rental_data.txt. The program will parse all of the filenames selected and only choose the appropriate files.

ISSUES: Once the database files are succesfully loaded there can be issues with the program if those files have been altered in some way outside of the program's operation. The program parse's the files in ways specific to their intended structure and as such will yield incorrect output if a file was left in a state other than this. To fix this you can delete all data from Customers.txt and rental_data.txt and be sure the files are then saved with the cursor at the very beginning of the file. In other words ensure that all spaces and things are deleted as well. Doing this should allow new customers to be created and the program's proper functionality to be seen.
