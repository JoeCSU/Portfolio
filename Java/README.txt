The files in these folders were created as part of a graduate school course on OO Design Patterns. 

The files in /DesignPatterns are smaller and implement a specific pattern, whereas those in /BiggerProjects are more full featured, though by no means intended to be seen as finished.

The time frame during which all of these projects were written was 3 months, with the BiggerProjects being written in 1-1.5 months.
