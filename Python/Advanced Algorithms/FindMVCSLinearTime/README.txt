This program finds a maximum value subsequence in a sequence of input data, it was written for a graduate level course on Advanced Algorithms. The output is the sequence itself though this can easily be modified to output the sum of the sequence. Input must only contain integers, and is only useful if the input sequence has both positive and negative integers. The running time of the algorithm is O(n).
