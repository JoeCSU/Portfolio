            <strong>Who We Are:</strong>

        </p>
        <p >
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We at ExamApp Services Inc. are a brand new startup (actually, not even that yet) whose goal is to help usher in the new era of online education with a fully integrated suite of low cost educational products that can be leveraged by any organization to bring better education to everyone. We are a small group of independent software developers and concerned citizens. We have run the gamut of various online educational tools, companies, services, platforms, course shells, and program levels. We are university and college graduates, cert heads, mooc lovers, and those who were previously frustrated by these,(or still are), and their costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Mission:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hear a lot these days about &quot;influencers&quot;, billionaires, media and news critics, sports, music, and movie stars, etcetera. We think though, that EVERYONE is an influencer, from the storied Ivy League professor, to the average Joe, the high school dropout, and even the current or former convict. Everybody influences each other, and rather than spending our efforts asking billionaires to save the world we feel we can better it from the ground up. To this end there is no better way in our minds than to strive to see everyone mentioned above, and those in between, get the best education possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Goals: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;We envision a fully integrated suite of educational products. What does this include?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>- Desktop Exam Applications </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>- Web Exam Applications </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>- Web, Mobile, and Desktop learning resources </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>- Administration and Creation tools for Educators </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>- Proctoring Services </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>- A Platform where Educators can easily Collaborate </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By integrating all of the above institutions will be able to not just make education more available, but also improve the quality of that education, and more easily tailor the delivery mechanisms and level of rigor to specific audiences. Institutions we think might benefit:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>- Universities and Colleges </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>- BootCamp Programs </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>- Organizations providing certification courses </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How We Differ: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many such services available already, MOOCS, organization specific certification courses, proctoring services, and both web and desktop exam programs, all offered through different companies. We think though that collaboration, not division, is key to providing excellent educational services. By integrating proctoring services with exam delivery, and educator collaboration we can make these services much easier for everyone to understand and use. This will allow Educators to have a single goto platform so that they can concentrate on teaching rather than learning their school&#39;s latest online course shell. Students will be able to concentrate on learning rather than worrying that their submission was received, or how to enter an answer on a timed exam in a test program they&#39;ve never used before. By providing a platform like this, we think we can not only lower the cost of delivering these services, but also allow the saved resources to be put to better use.
